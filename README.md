I am providing the link below</br>
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/100-days-of-code-a-complete-guide-for-beginners-and-experienced/#</br>
This course covers the following major topics
1. Data Structures and Algorithms (Coding part and problem solving)
2. System Design
3. Operating System and DBMS (database management system)
4. Object-Oriented Design
5. Cultural Fit</br>

Few things to need to keep in mind before we continue with the roadmap…</br>

1. If you’re a beginner then make the target to solve almost 450-500 coding questions.
2. If you’re an experienced person then make the target to solve almost 300 to 350 questions.
3. System design round is mostly asked from experienced people so beginners have to focus on this section less but experienced one has to focus on this section more.
4. If you’re a beginner then try to commit your time for at least 4-6 hours every day.
5. If you’re an experienced one then you need to commit for 2-3 hours every day.
6. Ideally, you shouldn’t take more than 20–30 minutes to solve any given problem but keep in mind that this rule is not applicable to all the questions.
