Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and 
applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), 
an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed in Java development. 

Now we need an environment to make a run of our program. Henceforth, JRE stands for “Java Runtime Environment” 
and may also be written as “Java RTE.” The Java Runtime Environment provides the minimum requirements for 
executing a Java application; it consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and supporting files. 

Now let us discuss JVM, which stands out for java virtual machine. It is as follows:

A specification where the working of Java Virtual Machine is specified. 
 But implementation provider is independent to choose the algorithm. Its implementation has been provided
 by Sun and other companies.
An implementation is a computer program that meets the requirements of the JVM specification.
Runtime Instance Whenever you write a java command on the command prompt to run the java class, 
 an instance of JVM is created.
